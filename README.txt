Password manager written in C#, mainly for the UI support so it will look nice and pretty.

Currently configured to connect to a SQL Server Database, but where you have the connection string, you can modify it to connect to different types of databases.

#TODO:
 Add support for multiple databases (MySQL, Postgres, etc.) because the connection strings are different for each type.
 Make an actual pretty UI.
 Add a makefile so people can compile it on like Linux or actually at all because this is all just source code, no binaries.
